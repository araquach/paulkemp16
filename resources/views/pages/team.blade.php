		<h1>The Team</h1>
		<p>The Jakata team comprises of eight skilled stylists, all from different hairdressing backgrounds, all displaying a diverse range of skills.</p>
		<p>Over the years Jakata has trained and developed a number of people to exceptional standards, whilst taking on already established stylists. This mix of talent creates a dynamic team with stylists well suited to anyone with a desire for a fashion forward
			look.</p>
		<p>A year ago the team divided into two when we opened our sister salon <a href="http://www.paulkemphairdressing.com" target="_blank">Paul Kemp Hairdressing</a> due to outgrowing our Bridge Street premises. Both teams continue to grow both in number and
			skill.</p>
		<p><em>It's difficult to find a stylist well suited to your needs, take the time to read each staff members profile to find the right fit for you. Prices for each stylist vary dependant on a number of factors (experience, specialised skills, high demand etc.)</em></p>
		<p><strong>Please call to arrange for a complimentary consultation with any of our team members.</strong></p>
