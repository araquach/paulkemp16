<h2>Schwarzkopf Professional Elite Symposium</h2>
<p><strong>Hairdressers always love the opportunity to meet up with like minded people to share ideas and see what’s happening in the industry as a whole. There are usually a few events each year put on by the major product suppliers (Tigi, Schwarzkopf GHD) geared at salons coming together to keep up to date with the latest movements in the hairdressing industry.
</strong></p>
<p>When we were told about the <em>Schwarzkopf Professional Elite Symposium</em> - a day of seminars, competitions, product launches, black tie(ish) meal and a night club - we knew we had to get as many of the team going for inspiration and education (plus we always love a good  party session!). We ran an incentive in the salon and 10 of the guys from across both salons won tickets to join the 300+ hairdressers invited to the event.
</p>
<p><strong>Matt Lane</strong> was one of the stylists from JAKATA who attended and I asked him to write an article about his experience&hellip;

<p>The <em>Jakata</em> and <em>Paul Kemp Hairdressing</em> team’s set off together on their drive down to Birmingham on a very sunny bright morning  - after much discussion on what we were going to wear!</p>
<p>We arrived at the Belfry Golf club, which was venue for the <em>Schwarzkopf Professional Elite Symposium</em> - an all day hairdressing event for hairdressing professionals across the UK.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Belfry we were greeted by Schwarzkopf account managers who sorted us out with tea and coffee - no doubt to keep us awake! While we were waiting to go into the first session we were able to get a glimpse of the models getting their makeup done for the stylists who were entering the competition later on.
</p>
<p>At around 12 a gourmet lunch buffet was provided which was delicious!</p>
<p>Shortly after that we were ushered into the <em>Essential Looks</em> event room. The stage was lit with vibrant coloured spot lights and dressed with banners and posters from the latest collections.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/symposium4.jpg', 'Steven McDowell') }}
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/symposium5.jpg', 'Osis') }}
<p>We found our table and <em>Steven McDowle</em> welcomed us to the event and went on to introduce the re-launch of the <em>Schwarzkopf Osis</em> product range. We were talked through the new Osis products for prep, style, texture and finishing. <em>‘Bouncy Curls’, ‘Damped’, ‘Curl Honey’, ‘Under Coat’, ‘Hairbody’, ‘Mighty Matte’, ‘Big Blast’, ‘Play Tough’, ‘G-force’ and ‘Tame Wild’</em> completed the line-up.</p>
<p>Following this the <em>Essential Looks</em> show started. This seasons Essential looks is called ‘Made To Create’ and comprises of 3 main Trends for spring/summer recreated by the Schwarzkopf ambassador stylists <em>Charlie Taylor, Andy Smith, Kay Brady and Kevin Caan</em>. Showcasing their interpretation of ‘Urban Sports’, ‘Freecreation’ and ‘Future Wave’. Models were brought on stage to display all 3 trends, breaking down each look and explaining the colouring/cutting/styling techniques used.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/symposium6.jpg', 'Essential Looks') }}
<p><strong>Urban sports</strong> focused on the sporty side of fashion with light breathable fabrics with trainers. The colour was inspired by the new <em>Igora Colourworx</em> intense colours to create bold colour effects or panels hidden to add interest.  The styling was a mixture of short texture, loose messy topknots, flicks and quiffs plus sleek, straight hair.</p>
<p><strong>Freecreation</strong> fashion statements are layered looks with raw graphic shapes, the colour direction is blonde hues and tones, using freehand techniques. Styling is bold, statement shapes, choppy texture and long silky tamed hair.</p>
<p>And finally <strong>Future Wave</strong> was a space-aged trend led by pure crisp whites and silver metallic’s but with modern age twist by incorporating jackets and hoodies. The colour inspiration was inspired by Igora nude tones to create effortless colour. The style direction was looking more towards volumised curls but also sleek waves, geared towards a modern and commercial look.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/symposium7.jpg', 'Inspire UK') }}
<p>After the presentation we watched  the <em>Inspire Live UK</em>, a competition with stylist’s from different salon’s all around from UK displaying their colours, cut’s and styling inspired by fashion and previous Essential Looks. ‘A competition that gives the next generation of Schwarzkopf’s hairdressing talent their chance to shine’. It was very exciting and inspiring  - so you never know, next year one of us might be entering!!</p>
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/symposium_group.jpg', 'Group Shot', array('class' => 'news-image')) }}
<p>We checked into our rooms and started to get ready with a few cheeky drinks to set the night off well. We made our way back, all suited &amp; booted. We were greeted with a glass of champagne and got the opportunity to chat and mingle with stylists from various salons from around the UK.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/symposium8.jpg', 'Meal Time') }}
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/symposium9.jpg', 'Team Shot') }}
<p>A three course meal followed complete with lots and lots of wine! Once we had eaten the winners were announced for the <em>Inspire Live UK</em> final and from there we made our way to the <em>Bel Air nightclub</em> which was on the grounds of the hotel. We partied the night away&hellip; it’s safe to say there were a fair few salon’s on the dance floor along with lots of booze and good times!  &hellip;however the day after was a different story!</p>
<p><strong>Overall it was a great experience, speaking with people from other salons, the stylists on stage and the stylist entering the competition.  I personally had so much fun and feel really inspired by this year’s Essential Looks!!! Can’t wait for next year!</strong></p>

<h2>Colour Masters</h2>
<p><strong>Last year was a big movement in our education department. Our focus was on putting our stylist through their paces. We have always had a strong focus on eduction and developing our team’s skill sets, but to further this we put all of our senior team members through a colour master class.</strong></p>
<p>The Schwarzkopf Professional Colour Master Class represents a gold standard in colour education with an innovative delivery method. The learning units are dedicated to all aspects of colour, from the philosophy of colour, interpretation, selection and application. The focus of this course is not only on theory of colour but also a practical hands-on experience.</p>

<section class="hidden">
<p>Colour isn’t just a trend-led creative process, it’s a technical speciality which requires years of training and constant education to keep you ahead of the game and up to speed on trends, techniques and product updates. A fantastic colourist also needs to have an advanced understanding of the technical aspects of colour and the processes involved, including how best to implement those techniques for each individual client.</p>
<p>Maisie &amp; Laura travelled to London on a regular basis throughout the year to train with Schwarzkopf’s National technical specialists. Completing a final exam at the end of the year all of our team passed with flying colours… no pun intended! Now qualified colour masters they have brought the education back to the rest of the team. We have really seen a massive step up in our teams colour knowledge.</p>
<p>Natalie was recently promoted to Senior Stylist level and as part of her movement up the ranks she will also be completing the course over the next 12 months to her in line with the other senior team members.</p>

<h2>What does winter do to your hair?</h2>
<p><strong>As we’re moving into winter and the weather is getting colder and damper, many of us notice significant changes in the condition and texture of our hair. Here at Jakata we have come up with some easy tips for you to follow to keep your hair looking bouncy and static free this Christmas.</strong></p>
<p>When it’s cold outside we tend to pump our heating up to full blast. This dramatic change from cold to hot ensures our hair gets put through its paces! Cold air can cause the cuticle layer of the hair to lift, and going into a warm, dry interior environment then draws the moisture out of the hair, leaving it dry and frizzy. This also provides the perfect conditions for static, which we all know makes for unruly hair! Wind can also cause hair issues of its own. Exposure to strong winds can cause the hair to tangle. The wind blows the hairs against each other which roughens the cuticle causing the hairs to catch on one another.</p>
<p class="reveal">Read more &gt;</p>
</section> <!--end .visible-->
<section class="hidden">
{{ Html::image('/images/newspics/bc_repair_rescue_treatment.jpg', 'BC Repair Rescue Treatment') }}
<p>To avoid these winter shocks to the hair, keep up-to date with your conditioning treatments. An intensive treatment is recommended about once a week, which you can carry out at home. Warm up a towel under hot water to wrap around your head after applying your treatment and keep this on for 10 minutes to replenish and lock in all the moisture you will be lacking. We recommend Schwarzkopf Moisture Kick Treatment or Repair Rescue Deep Nourishing Treatment.</p>
<h3>Hat Hair</h3>
<p>Nobody wants hat hair but it does seem unavoidable during the winter months. We recommend not applying your finishing products until you have taken your hat off (keeping a small supply in your desk draw at work is always handy).</p>
<p>Before you put your hat on, tie your hair in a loose bun on top of your head then when you take it out you will have a nice loose bounce to your hair. Alternatively you can platt your hair loosely under your hat to give a soft wave effect when taken out.</p>

<h2>Love colour but hate the damage?</h2>
<p><strong>Everyone loves to change their colour from time to time (or for some people every month!) As hairdressers we love the challenge of turning black hair blonde or blonde hair red, but with every colour change there is damage caused by the tint or bleach. 
A revolutionary new product by Schwarzkopf has just been launched and it is proven to reduce damage by 94%!</strong></p>
<p><em>FibrePlex</em> is Schwarzkopf’s first bond enforcing system to keep our silky, beautiful locks in amazing condition even with the most extreme colour changes. Thanks to the latest innovations in hair care we can all protect our hair from the damaging effect of tint and bleach.</p>
<p>At JAKATA we are now offering all of our colour clients this exclusive, in-salon, colour service booster as an add-on.</p>
<p class="reveal">Read more &gt;</p>

<section class="hidden">
{{ Html::image('/images/newspics/fibreplex1.jpg', 'Fibreplex') }}
<p>We’ve had this almost too-good-to-be-true product in the salon a few weeks now and we’ve been putting it to the test&hellip;</p>
<p>Senior stylist Maisie says
<em>“The possibilities for colour now seem endless - it’s an affordable colour booster for all of our clients. It means bigger colour jobs can potentially be carried out in one appointment instead of four or five.”</em></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HeN7iiDRpME" width="90%" height="315" class="right" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p>Suzi Thompson recently had FibrePlex as part of her colour visit after Natalie explained the benefits. She said
<em>“The condition of my blonde is loads better than normal and the darker colour in my hair seems to be staying in better and not washing out as fast”</em></p>
{{ Html::image('/images/newspics/fibreplex_nat.jpg', 'Fibreplex', array('class' => 'news-image')) }}
<p><strong>The launch of this product is huge for the hairdressing industry. Almost on the scale of the launch of GHD’s!</strong></p>
<p class="big"><em>So can we really put a price on healthy hair?</em></p>
<p class="big">For all of our wonderful existing and future colour clients we are offering FibrePlex for just £10 on top of your regular colour service price. This includes a FREE in salon  conditioning treatment.</p>
<p class="offer">And as if that’s not enough protection there is also a take home treatment for only £12.50. Use this twice a week and it will build and prep your hair for your next colour adventure!</p>

<h2>Stylists Battle it out in Essential Looks Competition</h2>
<p><strong>Every season Schwarzkopf launch their Essential Looks collections, a set of styles influenced by future hair/fashion trends. Every time the new collections are launched we have an in—salon workshop run by a Schwarzkopf educator to keep everyone up to date with the latest looks.</strong></p>
<p>This time we thought we’d mix it up a bit and have an in-house competition. We teamed up with Paul Kemp Hairdressing and paired everyone off. Each pair of stylists had to create their own interpretation of a colour &amp; cut from the latest Essential Looks collections on a training head.</p>

<p>Jimmy said “It’s a brilliant way to get the staff on board with new cutting and colour trends, the Essential looks are always ahead of the game and are a great inspiration to the teams. The competition allows them to try out some new techniques”</p>
<p>The competition was judged by Adam, Jimmy and Steve from Schwarzkopf with bronze, silver and gold awards given out for the best interpretations of the styles.</p>
<p>The winners this time were Leon (from Paul Kemp Hairdressing) and Vikki (from Jakata) who did a bold bob inspired from the ‘Pearlescent Girls’ collection.</p>

<h2>Ultimate Summer Blondes</h2>
<p><strong>With summer almost here we'll soon be inundated with requests for dark to lights or brighter lighter blondes. There's just something about summer that makes everyone want to go blonde!</strong></p>
<p>Before you get excited about the thought of those bright blonde locks, put a little time into thinking about the best steps to take to achieve the perfect result.</p>

<p>The first thing you should think about is the preparation of your hair before the service followed by the end result you want and then then how you're going to maintain the colour afterwards.</p>
<p>For me the biggest importance comes from what you do in the two months in advance of having the in salon service. Ask yourself what really makes one blonde better than another blonde?</p>
<p>The answer is the products that are used on your hair before, during and after the blonde service.</p>
<p>If you have really thought it through you would have spoken to you stylist on your last visit and discussed what to do before you have the colours applied. My best advice is you cannot get enough moisture and protein in your hair before you go ahead with the service. Start with Professional products before you go blonde (if you haven’t already) and get the foundations into the hair before you go ahead with the colour service.</p>
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/repair-rescue.jpg', 'Repair Rescue') }}
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/moisture-kick.jpg', 'Moisture Kick') }}
<p>Ask advice from your stylist about the best products to use in the months building up to your blonde service. It's vital to load the hair with protein &amp; moisture to ensure the healthiest result. In most cases I would recommend crossing the Schwarzkopf BC Repair range and the Bc Moisture kick range. Your going to be investing a fair bit of money on your next colour and cut, if you want the best result then why not spend the extra £40 - £60 on a great shampoo, conditioner, treatment &amp; moisture balm. These products used correctly will last you 3x the amount of time those high street brands, and the outcome of your hair is far superior.</p>
<p>With these foundations in place, your choices of levels of blondes are far greater and you will maintain the fullness, condition and shine of your hair. If your hair is already damaged then look into going on a recovery regime with Schwarzkopf BC Fibre Force. This will bring your hair back from the dead and ready for blondes in up to 10 weeks (depending on how damaged it is of course).</p>
<p>When it comes to having the actual lightening service, we have the most technologically advanced products available to give you your summer look. Bleaching hair has always had a stigma of being really damaging to the hair, drying it out and causing it to snap  - not anymore! We have two salon products which combine to create a perfect blonde with minimal damage, both from the Schwarzkopf 'Blonde Me' range:</p>
<h4>Pre lift Kera Protector</h4>
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/blonde_me_kera.jpg', 'Blonde Me Kera Protector') }}
<p>This is a revolutionary in-salon product that acts as a protective outer layer to your hair whilst allowing the bleaching products in to do their job whilst preventing all the swelling and cuticle damage that normally comes with a bleaching service. By having this applied you really do maintain healthy hair qualities - meaning less damage and more shine. This pre bleaching treatment does come with an additional charge of £5-£10, but it's a no brainer if it's going to keep your hair in fantastic condition.</p>
<h4>Blonde me Crystal bleach</h4>
{{ Html::image('images/newspics/blonde_me_crystal.jpg', 'Blonde Me Crystal Bleach') }}
<p>This state of the art bleaching agent is miles ahead of other bleaching products on the market. It's clear in colour so the stylist can really see how your hair is lifting. It's so soft on your hair you will notice the difference immediately, leaving minimal damage  and maximum moisture left in the hair. I find when I use it, it actually leaves the hair feeling better than before! If you want platinum white blonde then dependant on the lift needed this product may not be for you (we have another 'Blonde Me' bleach that lifts 9 levels with minimum damage!) but any other blondes and you will not be left disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>The main things to take from this are:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Use quality professional product's in the run up to the service.</li>
	<li>Ensure the highest quality salon products are used during the service</li>
	<li>Maintain the health and condition of your hair by continuing to use the products recommended by your stylist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jimmy Picked to join Schwarzkopf L.E.A.P team</h2>
<p><strong>The Jakata team is always striving to be at the top of our game. Regular competitions, both internal and external, plus photoshoots and training day's help each team member develop their skills to the highest level. These skills obviously have an impact on the level of work we produce day-to-day in the salon, ensuring everyone that comes in goes out with a modern, fashionable style.</strong></p>
<p>Over the years we've picked up numerous awards including categories within the prestigious L'oreal Colour Trophy and Redken NYC Awards. We've also had team members chosen to join larger artistic teams.</p>
<p>A few years ago Jimmy Sharpe was picked to spend a year on the Schwarzkopf Young Artistic team. He had to go through a gruelling selection process to win the place. From the experience he learned a multitude of new skills, from new hair techniques to stage presentation skills. Jimmy has used his knowledge to train and inspire the whole Jakata team.</p>

<p>Schwarzkopf this year have formed a brand new team called L.E.A.P. The L.E.A.P team is an art team aimed at development and progression towards Schwarzkopf ambassador status. It has a focus on not only creative styling &amp; fashion but other important things often overlooked like how to network, who's who in the industry, presentation work and PR work.</p>
<p>Jimmy's name was put forward for the team by Schwarzkopf as he stood out when he was on the Young Artistic Team. It's a very select group - just eight people from the whole of the UK! Everyone on the team was selected for having the right mentality and willing to pursue their careers further. The whole team are all previous award winners that have been on artistic teams that were aimed at people under 25.</p>
<p>Jimmy said "<em>I still can't believe that I've been selected to join this highly prestigious team. The variety of training and inspiration is overwhelming. Not many people get the chance to spend days with industry greats like top session stylists <a href="http://louisbyrne.blogspot.co.uk" target="_blank">Louie Byrne</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.tylerjohnston.com" target="_blank">Tyler Johnson</a>, top hair/fashion photographer <a href="http://www.therawsonpartnership.net" target="_blank">John Rawson</a> , plus loads of others! This is going to be an amazing year!</em>"</p>
<p><strong>We're all extremely proud that he's been selected and can't wait to soak up some of the new knowledge that he'll be sharing.</strong></p>
<p class="offer_heading"><strong>Over the course of the year we'll be keeping up to date with Jimmy's experiences on the team. We'll be sharing them on Facebook, Twitter and our sites news page.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We'd like to introduce you to the newest member of the Jakata family - Jaxson Welsby. Born on Monday 10th march at 19.50 and weighing in at 6 lb 2 1/2. Proud mum, Jakata stylist Vikki Rowland couldn't be happier.</strong></p>
<p>The team (and her clients) are missing Vikki, but we're all chuffed that she can spend some valuable time with Jaxson over the next few months.</p>
